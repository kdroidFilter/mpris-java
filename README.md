# mpris-java

100% Pure java implementation of MPRIS (MPRIS D-Bus Interface Specification)

Taken from the freedesktop.org site:

The Media Player Remote Interfacing Specification is a standard D-Bus interface which aims to provide a common programmatic API for controlling media players.

It provides a mechanism for discovery, querying and basic playback control of compliant media players, as well as a tracklist interface which is used to add context to the active media item.

## Demo Application

A demo application is included to show how to use this library to create a media player that displays notifications. The demo can be found in the `src/main/java/org/mpris/demo` directory. See the [demo README](src/main/java/org/mpris/demo/README.md) for more information on how to run and use the demo.
